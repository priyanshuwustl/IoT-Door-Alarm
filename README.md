# IoT Door Alarm
Implemented on: Particle Photon

Team: Priyanshu Jain, Ryan Leach

Setup Instructions: Refer to developer documentation [here](/docs/developer/README.md).

Personal Contribution (Priyanshu):
* Made the required circuit on a breadboard.
* Implemented hardware logic for particle photon.
* Helped debug particle cloud communication errors in the UI.

Basic File Details:
* 'AlarmController' contains the .ino, .h, and .cpp files for controlling the Photon, in addition to the standard libraries OneWire and SparkDallasTemperature, which is a wrapper for the OneWire library that makes temperature easy to handle
* 'docs' contains the original plan for the project, progress reports, and information for both users and developers
* 'ui' contains HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files that determine the appearance of the user interface in a web browser
